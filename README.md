# GS FileTree

This is a basic implementation of a file tree using Google Apps Script. It works both for plain text and can also create a spreadsheet with the file tree and the appropriate links.

## Installation

Just copy and paste the content from `macros.gs` in the appropriate Google Apps Script project linked to the Spreadsheet you want to be the File Tree. Then, insert the link of the folder you want as the Root of your file tree. Refresh the spreadsheet tab to get the custom menu (`Tree`).

## Other Info

I created this as a personal project to solve the needs I had, but I believe other people can be benefit by it. Feel free to leave an Issue and/or a Pull Request.
